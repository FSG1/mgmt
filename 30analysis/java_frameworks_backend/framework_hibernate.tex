		\textbf{Hibernate} \\
		Hibernate ORM (Hibernate in short) is an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language. It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database. Hibernate handles object-relational impedance mismatch problems by replacing direct, persistent database accesses with high-level object handling functions.
		
		Supports all criteria?\\
		\textbf{Doesn't support criteria 2,3}\\
		You need to use something else to handle HTTP/TCP communication.
		
		\textbf{Why use it?} \\
		Hibernate is used to make database connections easier. For simple use it's perfect.\\
		
		Pros:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Caching mechanism to bug database with similar queries.
		\item N+1 or Lazy loading support.
		\item Inheritance, encapsulation
		\end{enumerate}
		Cons:
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item Does not permit multiple inserts
		\item Supports less queries then JDBC.
		\item Not a good choice for small projects.
		\end{enumerate}
