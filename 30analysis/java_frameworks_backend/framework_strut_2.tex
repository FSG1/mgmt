		\textbf{Strut 2} \\
		Struts 2 is a pull-MVC framework. i.e. the data that is to be displayed to user has to be pulled from the Action.
		
		Supports all criteria?\\
		\textbf{Doesn't support criteria 1}\\
	 	Strut 2 needs an additional framework  to connect with a database.

 		\textbf{Why use it?} \\
		Strut 2 is a time endured framework. It's very powerful and can do many many things. \\
		
		Pros:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Configurable MVC components, which are stored in struts.xml file. If you want to change anything, you can easily do it in the xml file.
			\item POJO based actions. Struts 2 action class is Plain Old Java Object, which prevents developers to implement any interface or inherit any class.
			\item Support for Ajax, which is used to make asynchronous request. It only sends needed field data rather than providing unnecessary information, which at the end improves the performance.
			\item Whether you want to use JSP, freemarker, velocity or anything else, you can use different kinds of result types in Struts 2.
		\end{enumerate}
		Cons:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Compatibility
			\item Limited Documentation.
			\item UI driven framework.
		\end{enumerate}
