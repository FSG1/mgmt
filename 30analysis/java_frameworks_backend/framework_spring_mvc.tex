\textbf{Spring MVC} \\
Spring is a full blown MVC java framework.

Supports all criteria? \\
\textbf{Doesn't support criteria 1}\\
Spring needs an additional framework  to connect with a database.

\textbf{Why use it?}\\
Spring is a big time endured. It's very powerful and can do many many things.\\

Pros:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Simplified injection of test data through the use of Plain old Java object .
	\item Enhanced modularity, resulting in better code readability.
	\item Loose coupling between different modules.
	\item Dependency Injection (DI) flexible use.
	\item you can avoid using SQL scripts but still retrieve data from your database.
	\item You can also create a restful interface which can be extended later on by other programmers.
	\item You could also use spring security, so that only certain people have access to the rest interface.
	\item Easy to set up OATH2. 
\end{enumerate}
Cons:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Steep learning curve.
	\item Consequences of a conflict to an organization.
	\item Types of conflict.
	\item Identifying in which state a conflict is according to the conflict model somewhere in the sources.
\end{enumerate}
