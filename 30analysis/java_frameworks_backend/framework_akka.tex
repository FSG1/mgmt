		Welcome to Akka, a set of open-source libraries for designing scalable, resilient systems that span processor cores and networks. Akka allows you to focus on meeting business needs instead of writing low-level code to provide reliable behavior, fault tolerance, and high performance.
		
		Supports all criteria?\\
		\textbf{yes}
		
	 	\textbf{Why use it?} \\
		Compared to the other frameworks akka really has a benefit over them with their asynchronous ways. Most useful in a multi threaded environment.\\
		
		
		Pros:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Multi-threaded behavior without the use of low-level concurrency constructs like atomics or locks, relieving you from even thinking about memory visibility issues.
			\item Transparent remote communication between systems and their components, relieving you from writing and maintaining difficult networking code.
			\item A clustered, high-availability architecture that is elastic, scales in or out, on demand, enabling you to deliver a truly reactive system.
			\item Does not run on Java JEE server.
		\end{enumerate}
		Cons:
