Project future

As one can read at the previous part, the viewing part is completely implemented. The publishing and editing part is partially implemented. Deduced from this is that the publishing and editing should be fully completed. Things like editing a semester and editing curricula. Also the creation of modules and curricula. And their deletion.

Another important step to take is to implement versioning. This would increase the FMMS potential enormously. And when you have tracking, one needs to create a role based system to properly track the changes.

These are the most important steps to take for the next development traject.
