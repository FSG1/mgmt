planning
- clear all questions
- for each story there should be clear what the outcome is
- go through all topics and discuss it, what should the (business) result be
- Mockups included in user stories / product backlog
- Maybe TestCase when is the user story finished. For example: log in with username and password and see profile page

- Planning: numbers should be relative numbers
-- do not use all cars, only small parts
-- Add reason to user story, get a deep meaning how it contributes to the business

- Estimate User Stories
-- Ready to estimate -> take your cards
-- Very first estimation: take an easy one (agreed upon by all)
-- If someone is higher or lower than others, discuss it openly
-- NOT DOING AVERAGE
-- Keep it simple
