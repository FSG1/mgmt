\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This document defines the development of personal skills during the Software Factory (SoFa) module.
During this module some learning goals should be met which contributes to the final skills of the Informatics study.
~\\
Section \ref{sec:current} provides an overview over the current skill level (see Table \ref{currentskills}) according to the HBO-I matrix as defined in \glqq HBO-I Domain Description Bachelor of ICT\grqq.

The next section deals with the target skill level (see Table \ref{targetskills}) and how this level will be accomplished. The concrete improvements are marked in red.

The third section explains how the target skills will be reached in detail. It defines how the progress will be measured and when at which point the target will be reached.

As part of the learning goals, a topic has to researched. This research topic will be described in section \ref{sec:research}.

\subsection{Roles during the Project}

During the project, I have to fulfill some roles inside the team. These roles are described here:

\paragraph{DevOps Engineer} As a DevOps Engineer I am responsible to set up a fully automated continuous integration pipeline, which automatically tests all parts of the software. After a successful test, the software should  automatically be delivered to the customers, which means deployment on a server (continuous delivery). 

Neither continuous integration nor continuous delivery have been taught during our study, but is a current development in software development leading to shorter development cycles, better tested software, and reduced bug costs.


\paragraph{Backend Developer} As a backend developer I am responsible for implementing the necessary API endpoints into the backend. The endpoints are defined by the software architect who also defines the data structure which has to be sent to the client. The backend then takes care of a request, loads the needed data from the database and convert the data to the correct structure.

\paragraph{Database Engineer} As a database engineer I take care of the database and the data inside. I am responsible for the table structure and the constraints which will be enforced on database level (for example: foreign keys).
The database structure and data need to be stored inside the repository to archive them. Furthermore they should be importable to the other group members so everybody can have his local development database.
