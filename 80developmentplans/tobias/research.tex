\section{Research Topic}
\label{sec:research}

As research topic I will research on different approaches how to set up a continuous integration and continuous delivery infrastructure.
Therefore I need to research current industry standards as well as bleeding edge technology approaches for example infrastructure as a service or containerization.

Prior to the research, I will define requirements which should be met by this infrastructure (see Section \ref{ai3}).
The results of the research will be composed into a research report. Part of this report will be a proposal for a concrete infrastructure which meets the predefined requirements and can be implemented in our project.
