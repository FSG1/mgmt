As research topic to fulfill learning goal LG3, I will research on different approaches how to set up a continuous integration and continuous delivery infrastructure.
Therefore I need to research current industry standards as well as bleeding edge technology approaches for example infrastructure as a service or containerization.

Before the research, I will define requirements which needs to be met by the infrastructure and will discuss them with both the team and the customer.
After the research, there should be a proposal for an infrastructure which meets the predefined requirements.
