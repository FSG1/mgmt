\section{Development Plan}
\label{sec:development}

This section describes how I want to reach the targeted skill levels and how I want to measure or prove that I reached them.
The definition of each level and an example as stated in the HBO-I domain description is included in each sub section.

\subsection{Manage Infrastructure Level 3}

Managing infrastructure on level 3 will be accomplished by setting up a running prototype of our application using different servers.
Furthermore, as the DevOps Engineer, I need to set up a deployment pipeline to a certain server which deploys the application regularly and automatically. This requires an infrastructure of different server and services.

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Infrastructure / Manage / Level 3}: \\
	\textit{
		Horizontal synchronization of ICT management (suppliers, third-party) and vertical synchronization.
		Set up and implement a cloud-based public or private infrastructure.
	} \\ (HBO-I Domain Description, p22)
\end{quote}


\subsection{Analyse Infrastructure Level 3}



\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Infrastructure / Analyse / Level 3}: \\
	\textit{
		Conduct trend research in the field of ICT infrastructure, based on (international) technological, economic en social developments and innovations. 
		Execute a company infrastructure requirements analysis in order to identify functional and non-functional requirements.
	} \\ (HBO-I Domain Description, p22)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Manage Software Level 3}

Managing software on level 3 will be accomplished by setting up a delivery plan how releases will be carried out to the customer. Furthermore the use of scrum will ensure a proper change management: Before each sprint, the implemented product functions needs to be well defined and cannot be changed. Changes to functions or new functions can only be implemented in an upcoming sprint.

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Software / Manage / Level 3}: \\
	\textit{Implement configuration, change and release management.} \\
	(HBO-I Domain Description, p24)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Design Software Level 3}

Designing software on level 3 will be accomplished by creating a test strategy for the application and setup an automatic test environment. 

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Software / Manage / Level 3}: \\
	\textit{
		Set up a software architecture for a software system, consisting of both existing and new systems, taking into account both quality aspects and stakeholders. 
		Draw up a test strategy for system tests.
	} \\ (HBO-I Domain Description, p25)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Implement Software Level 3}

Implementation of software on level 3 will be accomplished by implementing the product functions using different kinds of technology and frameworks. These technologies and frameworks has to be chosen carefully, taking customer needs and existing architecture parts into account.
While implementing the application, unit tests will be written and automatically tested using a continuous integration approach. As the DevOps Engineer, it is my job to setup such an approach and supervise this process.

\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Software / Manage / Level 3}: \\
	\textit{
		Build and make available a software system in line with existing systems and on the basis of the designed architecture, using existing frameworks.
		Using test automation when performing tests.
	} \\ (HBO-I Domain Description, p25)
\end{quote}


\subsection{Professional Behavior Level 3}

The Professional Behavior Skill on level 3 will be accomplished by carrying out the project in a professional and defined way. \\
At first there will be a quality plan which defines the overall quality standards for the various parts of this project.
This quality standards include a review process which will be applied to all documents to ensure a certain level of quality. 
Every document produced needs to be reviewed by another group member. \\

Furthermore, all configuration items will be listed inside a configuration item table. The table is intended to keep track of all items and who is owner of this item. Also after each update of a configuration item, the table needs to be updated as well to keep track of the newest version. \\

During the development process we will incorporate the scrum development approach which allows us to easily fulfill our customers requirements. One of the most important requirement is, that we can deliver a working product. Scrum ensures that at the end of each sprint, a working product in a well defined state can be delivered. The consequent use of scrum will also improve my knowledge about this development approach and how to carry out such a process.
