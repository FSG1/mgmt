\section{Introduction}
This document will describe my learning goals during the SoFa project.

In this project I have taken on two roles listed below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Quality Manager
	\item Scrum Master
\end{itemize}

I will learn how to write useful quality management plans for our team and perform quality control in this project like reviews. I will also learn how to work as Scrum Master and setup and moderate every Scrum meeting that will take place.
