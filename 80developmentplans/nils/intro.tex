Section \ref{sec:current} provides an overview over the current skill level (see table \ref{currentskills}) according to the HBO-I matrix as defined in \glqq HBO-I Domain Description Bachelor of ICT\grqq.

The next section deals with the target skill level (see table \ref{targetskills}) and how this level will be accomplished. The concrete improvements are marked in red.

The third section explains how the target skills will be reached in detail. It defines how the progress will be measured and when at which point the target will be reached.

As part of the learning goals, a topic has to researched. This research topic will be described in Section \ref{sec:research}.



\subsection{Learning Goals}
