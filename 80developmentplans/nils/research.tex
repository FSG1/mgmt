\section{Research Topic}
\label{sec:research}
My research topic is about the framework "Angular" and how to implement a software product with this framework, since for me it is an innovative framework. What are the features and functions of this framework and which technologies are part of it. Furthermore what are best-practices for problems with this framework during the development process. During my research I will participate in an Angular course on the "udemy" platform and as literature I use the Angular Handbook of the "Angular. io" website. For implementation and consulting, the results of this research serve as a basis for decisions and possible changes. The result of this research will be a written Research report at the end of the project.
