\subsection{Backend frameworks}

There are many Java frameworks. Which one to use and why? That's the purpose of this research. \\

The research will be conducted on what back-end framework's to use. All frameworks will be checked on the criteria needed for the project. If a framework doesn't support a criteria this will be noted and how to work around it. The framework proposal will be made once the research is finished. And the group can decide on which framework to use based on the research and proposal.\\
