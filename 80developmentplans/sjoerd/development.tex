\label{sec:development}

\subsection{Software management}
As role as configuration manager level 3 of software management will be reached. The configuration manager will keep track of software and is responsible of deliverables. As individual programmer there also lies the responsibility to manage the software written.

\subsection{Software advice}
Doing research into frameworks to use for the project will give a level 3 on advice. The environment is not role played and deals with real life situations. This will enable a level 3 on advice.

\subsection{Design}
The software will be hand designed as software engineer. There will be group sessions in which the software will be discussed. The software design has to fit in and work in a proper way. There are no guidelines on how to do this all parts of the design process have to be carefully implemented.

\subsection{Professional Behavior}
Acting professional in a team with no real boss demands alot of an individual. Projects can only succeed by having a good professional behavior.

\subsection{Research skills}
Research has to be done on all technologies used. As one that is not familiar this is quite the challenge. Not being told how to do this this is quite a challenge as well.
