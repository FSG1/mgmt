\section{Development Plan}
\label{sec:development}

\subsection{Software management}
as groups configuration manager, level 3 of software management will be reached. The configuration manager will keep track of software and is responsible of deliverables. As individual programmer there also lies the responsibility to manage the software written.\\  
To properly fulfill my configuration manager I will pro-actively address other users of the group to fill in their created artifacts in the CI table and keep them updated.  \\
As group member I will also make entries into the CI table of my created artifacts and keep them updated. \\
The innovation part is that I created the Configuration management plan and it's guidelines.


\subsection{Software advice}
The research described in 5.1 will enable me to give an advice to the group. This research is done on my own initiative and using the research I will give an advice to the group pro-actively. During the daily SCRUM meetings I will also give advice on what path to take on my own initiative.

\subsection{Design}
My second role in the group is as Software architect. What this means is that I am responsible for the front-end back-end communication. I will document, create, update and communicate this design.
I will be proactive on the designing part and innovative in finding solutions that fit with each sprint \(not overengineering.\). The back-end architecture document will be proof of this process. Also other members using and implementing will be proof of reaching level 3 according to the HBO-I matrix.

\subsection{Software Implementation}
For Software Implementation I will learn a new framework and use it. I will communicate with interested parties within the group about the code I produced. I will document it and work SCRUM based. I will solve software problems front-end Innovative and proactive. The proof will be the code I produced.

\subsection{Professional Behavior}
In the daily meetings I will report on my done work and discuss the best path for the group. I will try to motivate the group to work harder by surprising them using innovative means.

\subsection{Research skills, for more information see 5.1}
I will choose a research topic that contributes to the project and will be used by the group. I will choose objective based criteria to make sure the research is valuable. Because we work in a group I will also take the skills and wishes of the group members into the research. The research will be proof of my Level 3. If the conclusion of my research is accepted by the group it shows Level 3 criteria as well. I will be innovative in finding good frameworks and proactive in analyzing the groups learning curve for the framework.
