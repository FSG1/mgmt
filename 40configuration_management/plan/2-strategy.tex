\chapter{Strategy}
This chapter has a high level overview of what can be expected of configuration management.


\section{Scope}
The configuration management will include all CI's of the projects. The CI are all things beloning to the project. Documents, hardware etcetera. CM also includes how to deliver what CI's to the stakeholders, the frequency and in what way. CM manager will also document how to use hardware/software related to the project. CI's used but not owned by the project will not be documented.

\section{Responsibility}
The CM manager is responsible for maintaining the structure of the CI table(CIT) and this document. Every owner of a CI is responsible for that CI and the documentation of that CI in the CIT.
