\chapter{Introduction}
This document described how configuration management (CM) will be executed and maintained throughout the SOFA project. This includes documenting how the configuration items (CI) are documented. The roles and who is responsible for what CI. This document will describe which CI's will be communicated with stakeholders and the frequency thereof. The CM plan is important because without it things may be badly documented, things may be missed or people may do more work then is necessary.
