\section{Software}
This section outlines the quality standards and processes for software development during the SOFA project.

\subsection{Code}
\begin{itemize}
	\item All code committed shall be committed alongside relevant testfiles.
	\item All code relevant to a new feature, fix or any other change will be developed in a new branch.
	\item Any branch that is to be merged into the master branch will be submitted in a pull request and reviewed by at least one person.
	Code reviews and any CI tool must also pass before merging.
	\item All code shall be 100\% tested at all time. If it is not, changes will not be accepted into the master branch.
	\item Tests shall be useful, concise and descriptive. Don't test only one scenario, but every scenario imaginable.
	\item All code shall be documented clearly, either by simple self documenting code or written documentation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Commits}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Commit messages will have a descriptive header describing the content of the commit.
	\item A commit message's body could explain more about the change. Why something is changed, what it does etcetera.
	\item Commits will remain small and relevant to only one change. If a commit changes more than two things, it is too big!
\end{itemize}
