\section{Documents}
This section outlines the quality standards and processes for all documents produced during the SOFA project.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item All documents shall be written in LaTeX.
	\item Every document's source and rendered result shall be committed and versioned.
	\item All documents shall be reviewed at least once by another person either inside or outside of the team using the template found at \nameref{pdf:review_template}.
	\item The results of document reviews shall be stored in the correct folder in the \texttt{25reviews/} directory with the following naming convention:\\
	\textbf{YYDDMM\_firstname\_documentversion}*
	\item An improved version of a document shall be reviewed once more to guarantee feedback has been processed and passes standards.
	\item If a document does not pass a review, this document shall be improved again.
	\item Documents to be reviewed will be added to the week's backlog.
\end{enumerate}

*So the first review of a project plan will have this path:
