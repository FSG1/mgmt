\chapter{Description}
In this chapter is a description of the assignment for this project followed by an explanation 
of the problem which is to be solved. Finally the goals of the assignment will be set.

\section{Assignment}
The assignment of this project is to develop a system to manage module descriptions within the Informatics
department of the Fontys University of Applied Science in Venlo. 

\section{Problem}
The customer wants a product to easily create, modify and publish module descriptions
for the Software Engineering and Business Informatics department of "Fontys Hogeschool Techniek en Logistiek" in the future.
\newline \\
Today there is no standardized way of creating and changing modules and their descriptions.
\newline \\
During the project our company will develop a software product to solve this problem.

\section{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Delivering a high quality but not necessarily finished product 
    \item Delivering proper documentation
    \item Delivering an extensible product
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\section{Approach}
To assure a high quality product we stick to the Agile development framework Scrum during the project.
A good documentation is achieved with our "SOFA Quality Guidelines" and "Software Requirements Specification" defined at the beginning of the project.
Careful consideration will have to be taking into account when designing parts of the system to ensure the end-product is extensible and easily understandable for possible other project teams who could continue with this project.
